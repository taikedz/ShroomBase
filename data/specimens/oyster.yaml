# Example entry file for a given shroom
# Items starting `$` are references that can be looked up from the "aliases.yaml" file
# Individual "notes" and "stages" entry can have a "sources" section
#   sources can be literal, or aliases, though one-off sources are discouraged.
#   Reference an authoritative source in a file for re-use.

# Note that using aliases provides easy searchability and so should be favoured
