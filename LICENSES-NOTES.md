# Licenses Notes and Responsible Distribution

### Code and Page Templates

Code license is LGPL - in the spirit of sharing information, the code for building a usable web site from the data files, as well as the code for the templates, is fuly open source. You may use the code and templates in your own site and projects for whatever purposes you see fit.

The design is intended to be useful to amateurs and professionals alike who simply want to track growable specimens of plants and fungi.

In short: if you modify the code of the builder or template and publish the output, you must share your changes with the community if requested to do so, and permit them to use your changes under the same license terms. No other part of your site or application would be however affected by this requirement. Any questions, do ask.

### Specimen Information Content

Content relating to describing and identifying species is conveyed to you under a CC-BY-NC-ND license.

This covers particularly content in the `./specimens/` folder.

**Responsible Distribution**

Notably, there is an additional caveat to incorporating the data into any site you might derive from this project's specimen data, through build or quoting: **in no way may you deliberately or carelessly repesent the information as having any authoritativeness.**

This data is the work of an amateur, and should be treated as such.
