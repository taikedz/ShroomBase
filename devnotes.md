Part of this is also so that I can have a project to work on to hone new dev skills.

* Templates
    * HTMX
    * TypeScript via bun
    * jQuery
    * Bootstrap (or Skeleton?)
    * NOTE: are jQuery and Bootstrap heavy?
* Build engine
    * use TypeScript via bun to create the YAML collator
        * new languages !
    * though again, trying to do it in Rust might not be a bad thing
        * it would just take much much longer...
